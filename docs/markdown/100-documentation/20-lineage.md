## The importance of lineage

# Graphical lineage

Data lineage relies on the use of `source()` and `ref()` macros, and is a tremendous tool to understand **where data comes from and where it goes** in your project.

It helps understand complexity and find rework you can do to make things simpler.

Lineage in dbt shows:

- Seeds
- Snapshots
- Sources
- Models
- Macros
- Tests
- Exposures
- Analysis

And the connections between all them.
