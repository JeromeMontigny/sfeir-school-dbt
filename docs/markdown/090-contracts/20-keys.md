# Declaring keys and constraints

Alongside data types for columns, dbt lets you define additional constraints:

- Primary and Foreign keys
- Uniqueness and not null requirement
- Value check

All constraints are not available for all adapters, and will produce either an error or a warning if they canâ€™t be enforced.

You can add constraints without enforcing contract.

Constraints are enforced in **tables only** and not on views or ephemeral models.

    contract:
      enforced: true
  constraints: # Model level constraints
  - type: primary_key
    columns: ['id']
    columns:
  - name: id
